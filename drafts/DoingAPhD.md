## General Advice
Starting a PhD is a major undertaking: one is signing up to thinking about a topic for many consecutive years, and being guided in their journey towards becoming an independent scientific thinker by a specific supervisor.

Don't forget that [research requires different skills than you are taught in undergrad](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com.au/2017/09/the-genius-fallacy.html).

### Picking a good supervisor
Of course it's very important to pick a research area you're passionate about.
But having a productive PhD experience often comes down to a strong supervisor-student relationship.

It's important to:
* respect the research content and style of your supervisor: read their papers and other outputs they've produced.
* work productively and feel supported through your PhD tenure: if possible, do a short research project with the potential supervisor to get a feel for the relationship.

_All supervisors have positives and negatives_

You should talk to the supervisor's past and current students to try to get an open and frank understanding of what being their student is like.
Once you have a clear picture of what the positives and negatives of your potential supervisor are, make the judgement about whether that combination will suit your style and what you hope to get out of your PhD.

### What next?
Some PhD graduates will pick a research career.
* If you try for an independent fellowship, these are very competitive. Here is [a thorough list of opportunities](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/postdoctoral/).
