## Statistics

### Numbers
* If your measurement is a physical quantity, _always_ accompany it with the physical units it was measured in.
Separate the unit with a small-space `\,` in Latex, e.g., `3\,m`, or using option-space in a text editor.

### Precision
Think about the number of significant figures that you report your measurements to.
Do not specify a quantity to greater precision than the order of magnitude of error in the measurement of that quantity.

* If you have an error associated with a measurement, (3.421 +/- 0.5), this tells you explicitly where the precision of the measurement is irrelevant: 3.4 +/- 0.5.
* _p_-values should always be reported to one significant figure (e.g., 0.04, not 0.037621). Ain't no one be caring about further precision.

## Text
* Use ampersands only when desperate for space (e.g., in tables).
* Semicolon must be followed by a full sentence (unless used to separate list items).
