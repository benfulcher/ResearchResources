# Organizing your time

## Electronic lab book

Modern scientists must use an electronic lab notebook.
These [Ten Simple Rules for Lab Notebooks](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385) give a good account of why.

I use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/); alternatives are [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) and [labarchives](https://www.labarchives.com/).

Much of being a creative scientist is managing time, and part of making effective use of time is keeping a comprehensive log of experiments, results, research meetings, seminar notes, general vague thoughts about research, etc.
Electronic notebooks keep this information searchable, and allow you to look over previous results and reproduce them.

Some tips:

* Date every entry.
* Copy and paste outputs of your analysis or code to keep a record of your research outputs as you produce them. Easy as a screenshot (on Mac: cmd-cntrl-shift-4 and then paste cmd-v).
* Copy the code of the functions and their inputs that you use to generate your outputs, to allow you to reproduce what you've done. Works best with version control.
* Tagging notes allows you to prioritize your time between tasks across multiple projects that require attention. I use `1-Now`, `2-Next`, `3-Soon`.

## Keeping track of your projects

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is good for keeping track of multiple tasks.
I always keep a main Trello board of all scientific projects I'm working on, organized across boards like: `backburner`, `student`, `current`, through to `submitted`, `in review`, and `published`.

<!-- ## Dividing tasks across a team

When dividing tasks across a team, other collaborative software can help.
[Asana](https://asana.com/) is another alternative that is better suited to assigning tasks with due dates across members of a team, and [Slack](https://slack.com/) is another popular one, despite being quite disruptive to focus. -->


<!--

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. -->

<!-- Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
