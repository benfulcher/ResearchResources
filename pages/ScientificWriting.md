### Writing well

Writing a good abstract is crucial---the vast majority of people are time-strapped and, if they get past your title, this is as much as they will read of your work.
So writing a clear statement of what you have done and how it impacts key open questions in a widely accessible way, is super important.
I find [this Nature template](https://www.nature.com/documents/nature-summary-paragraph.pdf) for how to structurea an abstract very informative.
