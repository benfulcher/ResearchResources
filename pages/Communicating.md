Presenting your work is a key part of being a scientist, and it requires careful thought, preparation, and practice to imagine the audience and take them on a journey from where they are to where you want to get them to.

Here is a useful image from [Itai Yanai](https://twitter.com/ItaiYanai) that helps depict a key difference between doing science and communicating science:

# Making posters

[A video](https://youtu.be/1RwJbhkCA58) on how to construct a good poster for a large conference.
Includes some great insights into the conference attendee experience.

# Making presentations

- [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/) is very nice to use, but is only for Mac, and doesn't allow version control.
- [Powerpoint](https://office.live.com/start/powerpoint.aspx), you know it.
- [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/) is a nice way to make presentations in markdown, but is only for Mac.
- [Marp](https://marp.app) is really nice in allowing markdown-based presentations, enabling very quick slide preparation, easy embedding of code and hyperlinks, and version control.
