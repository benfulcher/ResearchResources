# Making posters

[A video](https://youtu.be/1RwJbhkCA58) on how to construct a good poster for a large conference.
Includes some great insights into the conference attendee experience.

# Making presentations
* [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote/) is very nice to use, but is only for Mac, and doesn't allow version control.
* [Powerpoint](https://office.live.com/start/powerpoint.aspx), you know it.
* [Marp](https://marp.app) is really nice in allowing markdown-based presentations, enabling very quick slide preparation, easy embedding of code and hyperlinks, and version control.
