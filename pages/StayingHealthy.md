Scientific research can be a tough place to be immersed in--we are all constantly criticising ourselves and others in order to improve our understanding of the world around us.

Feeling part of the academic community and knowing that we do not struggle alone is important.
Places like twitter can make things worse (as people publicize successes), but can also help be part of a community that normalizes the struggles, regular rejections, etc.
