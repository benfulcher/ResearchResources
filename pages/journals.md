To get your work peer-reviewed, you need to submit it to a journal.
To make your work open access, most journals are for-profit and charge >$1000 to publish your work (too much of which ends up being profit for the publishing company).

Note that Sydney University has [Read and Publish Agreements](https://caul.libguides.com/c.php?g=941498&p=6840300) which covers article processing charges for many major journals.
