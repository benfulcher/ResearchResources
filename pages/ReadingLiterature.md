Some [strategies](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/11/how-keep-scientific-literature) on keeping up with the literature.

### The buzz
Twitter

### Direct from the journal's mouth: RSS feeds
Journals have RSS feeds that push new articles into an RSS reader.
This can be a good way to stay on top of new articles as they are published in a place that doesn’t fill up your inbox.
You can also create your own custom RSS feeds (e.g., in Scopus) to track authors you’re interested in, or sets of keywords most relevant to your research.

[Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is a good free choice to manage your RSS feeds. You can access the results either online, or via a native app.
On Mac/iOS, [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) is a good choice; [others](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-rss-reader-os-x/) exist.

### Reference managers
* [Papers](http://papersapp.com) is a nice, but not free, Mac software for reading and keeping a thorough bibliography.
* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) is a free alternative.
