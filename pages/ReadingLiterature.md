* A nice [science article](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/11/how-keep-scientific-literature) with strategies for keeping up with the literature.

### The buzz
If your field has a strong Twitter scene, and they are disciplined enough to avoid distracting personal posts, this can be an excellent way to find topical literature in your field.
Here's an [article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007513) for how to get started on twitter as a scientist.

### Direct from the journal's mouth: RSS feeds
Journals have RSS feeds that push new articles into an RSS reader.
This can be a good way to stay on top of new articles as they are published in a place that doesn’t fill up your inbox.
You can also create your own custom RSS feeds (e.g., in [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic)) to track authors you’re interested in, or sets of keywords most relevant to your research.

[Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is a good free choice to manage your RSS feeds. You can access the results either online, or via a native app.

On Mac/iOS, [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) is a really nice one; [other options](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-rss-reader-os-x/) also exist.

### Reference managers
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com) are decent, free reference managers.
* [Readcube Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/) is clunky and still quite buggy, but has a nice direct *add to library* feature from the web (but charges a regular fee).
 <!-- * [Papers](http://papersapp.com) was a nice, but no longer supported, Mac software for reading and keeping a thorough bibliography. -->
