## Accommodation

A summary, focused on longer-term stays, is [here](https://sydney.edu.au/campus-life/accommodation.html), with a [list of options for off-campus housing](https://sydney.studystays.com.au/).

### Short-term stays

Especially off-season, many of the residential colleges often have spare rooms that visitors can use. Try [emailing the accommodation team](mailto:accommodation.info@sydney.edu.au), or emailing specific colleges directly, e.g., from [this list](https://sydney.edu.au/campus-life/accommodation/live-on-campus/camperdown-darlington/residential-colleges.html) of current Sydney University colleges.

## Stuff to do
* Newtown is a fun area to explore. Campos does excellent coffee. Thier piccolo affogato is one of the best drinks in the world.

### Sydney in a day

My favorite day starts from Town Hall (or even better for coffee lovers is to start earlier from Gumption), then you walk through Hyde Park, past the Domain to the NSW Art Gallery (have a look around in there if you like art), then walk through the Royal Botanic Gardens to Lady Macquarie’s chair (where you can look out onto the harbor/opera house), walk over to Circular Quay for a ferry bound for Manly (Terminal 3).
Get a good spot on an outer deck and enjoy the ride over.
From the terminal, walk towards Manly beach, grabbing fish and chips and eating on the beach.
Have a swim, a couple beers at a beachside brewery, then ferry back for a drink at Circular Quay: Opera Bar for the views of the harbor, or a cocktail at Bulletin Place for cosy vibes.
While around Circular Quay, you can also slot in some time at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), Circular Quay, which for the cost of a coffee on the top floor, you can get some of the best elevated views of the harbor.
If you’re near Wynyard, I always enjoy Uncle Ming’s for a whiskey and apple.

### Classic walks:
The classic harborside walks are those between Bondi, Bronte, and Coogee beaches.
This coastal walk is one of the top things to do in Sydney.
It’s really easy and well maintained but also really unique and beautiful.

The following are a bit more adventurous (but all public transport-able!):
* [Spit Bridge to Manly in Sydney Harbour national park](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkwalking.aspx?id=n0039) (called Manly scenic walkway on the website)
* [Jerusalem bay to Brooklyn track](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkWalking.aspx?id=N0019) in Ku-ring-gai
* [The coast track](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkWalking.aspx?id=N0030) in Royal National Park
