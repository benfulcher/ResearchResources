## General Advice

Starting a PhD is a major undertaking: one is signing up to thinking about a topic for many consecutive years, and being guided in their journey towards becoming an independent scientific thinker by a specific supervisor.

### Picking a good supervisor

Of course it's very important to pick a research area you're passionate about.
But having a productive PhD experience often comes down to a strong supervisor-student relationship.

It's important to:
* respect the research content and style of your supervisor: read their papers and other outputs they've produced.
* work productively and feel supported through your PhD candidature: if possible, do a short research project with the potential supervisor to get a feel for the relationship.

_All supervisors have positives and negatives_

You should talk to the supervisor's past and current students to try to get an open and frank understanding of what being their student is like.
Once you have a clear picture of what the positives and negatives of your potential supervisor are, make the judgement about whether that combination will suit your style and what you hope to get out of your PhD.

### Getting through a PhD

A major reason why PhDs are difficult is that the skills that make a successful researcher are quite different to what make a good undergraduate student.
Here is some useful material on the challenges of research life:

* [Importance of seeking out opportunities to feel stupid](http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771)
* A reminder that [research requires different skills than you are taught in undergrad](http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com.au/2017/09/the-genius-fallacy.html).

## Doing a PhD with me at Sydney Uni

General information about doing a PhD at The University of Sydney is [here](https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pr/doctor-of-philosophy-science.html) and the application process for graduate research is described [here](https://sydney.edu.au/study/admissions/apply/how-to-apply.html#uniqueId_nPUe33Za_5_button).
The fundamental requirement to be admitted to a PhD is an academic qualification that included a significant research component.
Winning a PhD scholarship is very competitive, especially for international students.
Options are summarized [here](http://sydney.edu.au/scholarships/research/research-training-program.shtml).
If you're unsure about your competitiveness, feel free to contact me and I can help you to navigate the application process.

I have funding available to provide additional support to talented PhD students who are able to obtain competitive scholarship funding.

#### Funding for Local (Australian) PhD Students
You should apply for a Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship, or a University of Sydney Postgraduate Award (UPA).

#### Funding for International PhD Students
International Scholarships for Australia (Research Training Program or University of Sydney International Scholarship) are especially competitive.
High marks are a prerequisite for obtaining PhD funding; only applicants with a weighted average mean in excess of 80 (corresponding to a first-class honours) are considered.
As well as high marks, students typically require some research experience (such as a published paper), and students from highly-ranked institutions can also have an advantage.

Some details of the criteria used are [here](http://sydney.edu.au/scholarships/docsschols/Higher_Degree_by_Research_Scholarship_Selection_Process.pdf).
Some additional examples of funding sources for postgraduate research study are [here](http://sydney.edu.au/scholarships/postgraduate/international-postgraduate-scholarships.shtml).
Australia Awards are available for students from countries with which Australia has a bilateral aid program: [list of countries](https://dfat.gov.au/people-to-people/australia-awards/Pages/participating-countries.aspx).
The [Endeavour Scholarship](https://internationaleducation.gov.au/scholarships/scholarships-and-fellowships/Pages/default.aspx is another one to look into.
There is also PhD funding for [Chinese nationals](https://sydney.edu.au/scholarships/e/china-scholarship-council-research-programs-scholarship.html).

#### General funding sources

* An [IBM PhD fellowship](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/awards/phdfellowship.shtml) on high-throughput time-series analysis and machine learning.
* A full list of research scholarship funding for Sydney University is [here](http://sydney.edu.au/scholarships/research/faculty/science.shtml).

#### Preparing your application
Details for admission into a PhD program at Sydney University are [here]https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pr/doctor-of-philosophy-science.html).
Your PhD application will need to include [a research proposal](https://sydney.edu.au/campus-life/student-news/2017/05/30/how-to-write-a-research-proposal-for-a-strong-phd-application.html), which I will help you write around a specific research project, as well as two academic references.



### After a PhD

It's useful to think about what types of futures your present might lead to.
Some PhD graduates will pick a research career.
* If you try for an independent fellowship, these are very competitive.
Here is [a thorough list of opportunities](https://research.jhu.edu/rdt/funding-opportunities/postdoctoral/).
